# GoCD File Based Authentication Plugin

This is a file based authentication plugin which implements the GoCD [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization/) endpoint. This plugin allows authentication/search of users defined in a sinlge or across multiple password files.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## Requirements

These plugins require GoCD version v17.5 or above.

## Installation

- From GoCD `17.5.0` onwards the plugin comes bundled along with server, hence a separate installation is not required.

## Usage instructions

The simplest way to use this plugin is create a plain text file with the following format:

    [username]:[password hashed with SHA1 and encoded with base 64]
    
If your SHA1 algorithm and base 64 encoding works properly, the password "badger" should come out as "ThmbShxAtJepX80c2JY1FzOEmUk=".

You can put as many username/hashed password pairs as you like -- use a new line for each one

The plugin needs to be configured to use the password file. The configuration can be added by adding a Authorization Configuration
by visiting the Authorization Configuration page under Admin/Security.

Alternatively, the configuration can be added directly to the `config.xml` using the `<authConfig>` configuration.

* Example Configuration
```xml
<authConfigs>
  <authConfig id="auth-config-id" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
    <property>
      <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
      <value>path-to-password-file</value>
    </property>
  </authConfig>
</authConfigs>
```

The plugin can also be configured to use multiple password files if required.
* Example Configuration
```xml
<authConfigs>
  <authConfig id="auth-config-id-1" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
    <property>
      <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
      <value>path-to-password-file-1</value>
    </property>
  </authConfig>
  <authConfig id="auth-config-id-2" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
    <property>
      <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
      <value>path-to-password-file-2</value>
    </property>
  </authConfig>
</authConfigs>
```

## Generating passwords using htpasswd

You can use the [htpasswd](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/htpasswd.html) program from Apache to manage your password file.

You must use the -s option with htpasswd to force it to use SHA1 encoding for the password.

So for example, you can use the following command to create a password file called "passwd" and put the password for the user "user" in it:

```shell
 htpasswd -c -s passwd user
 ```

### htpasswd on Windows

htpasswd is not available on windows, but there are plenty of websites that perform the encryption for free. Make sure you use the SHA1 algorithm.

### htpasswd on Mac OSX

htpasswd is already installed by default on Mac OSX.

### htpasswd on Linux

Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) htpasswd can be installed from the apache2-utils

```shell
$ apt-get install apache2-utils
```

### Generating passwords using python

Another option is to use the following command (assumes python is installed on your system)

  ```python
  $ python -c "import sha;
  from base64 import b64encode;
  print b64encode(sha.new('my-password').digest())"
  ```

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## Note

This plugin is a as-is replacement for GoCD support for file based authentication. SHA1 is considered insecure and not recommended.
A file based [strong auth plugin](https://github.com/danielsomerfield/go-strong-auth-plugin#go-strong-auth-plugin) was built using the deprecated Authentication endpoints, any contributions towards building a secure file based plugin would be appreciated.
